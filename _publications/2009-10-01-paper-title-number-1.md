title: "IRSIM: A Switch-Level Simulator and Dynamic Power Analysis Tool"

permalink: /publication/WOSET-Paper
excerpt: 'IRSIM is an open-source switch level simulator that analyzes digital circuits at the device (transistor) level using a linear switch-based model that depends on whether a transistor is “on” or “off” but accounting for the resistance through the device for delay estimates. This event-based simulation makes IRSIM much faster than a device modeling simulator like SPICE, but slower than a Verilog simulator, which models circuits at the gate level yet lacks a power analysis component. However, since Verilog simulations are still much faster than IRSIM for logic simulations, IRSIM has been largely ignored, and its dynamic power analysis feature forgotten. In this paper, we discuss the software methods in IRSIM with particular emphasis on further improving its dynamic power analysis capabilities.'

Abstract: IRSIM is an open-source switch level simulator that analyzes digital circuits at the device (transistor) level using a linear switch-based model that depends on whether a transistor is “on” or “off” but accounting for the resistance through the device for delay estimates. This event-based simulation makes IRSIM much faster than a device modeling simulator like SPICE, but slower than a Verilog simulator, which models circuits at the gate level yet lacks a power analysis component. However, since Verilog simulations are still much faster than IRSIM for logic simulations, IRSIM has been largely ignored, and its dynamic power analysis feature forgotten. In this paper, we discuss the software methods in IRSIM with particular emphasis on further improving its dynamic power analysis capabilities.
